	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p><a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">Apache Cordova</a> is a build system for creating native apps with bundled HTML and JavaScript content. Apps built with Cordova are native apps that can be published on the app stores. Furthermore, you can add custom native plugins to extend the functionality of your app.</p>

	<p>To learn how to install Cordova and mobile SDKs on your system, please go to the <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">Build Overview</a>.</p>

	<p>Below we will cover how to set up and build a Cordova project.</p>
</div>

<div id="CreatingCordovaProject" class="box">
	<h2>Creating a Cordova Project</h2>
	<p>To create a Cordova project, do as follows:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Open a command-line window</li>
		<li>Go to a folder where you want the project subfolder to be created.</p>
		<li>Use the <b>cordova create</b> command to create a project. This command has the following form:
		<pre>cordova create project-folder app-identifier app-name</pre>
		Here is an example that will create a folder called "DemoProject" with project template files:
		<pre>cordova create DemoProject com.evothings.demoapp DemoApp</pre>
		Note that creating the project may take a while.</li>
		<li>To issue further Cordova commands, move into the project folder, e.g. by typing:<pre>cd DemoProject</pre></li>
	</ol>
</p>
</div>

<div id="BuildingForIOS" class="box">
	<h2>Building for iOS</h2>
	<p>Here is how you build your new Cordova project for iOS:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Make sure you are in the project folder in a terminal window</li>
		<li>Add the iOS platform to the project with the command:
		<pre>cordova platform add ios</pre></li>
		<li>Build the project for iOS using:
		<pre>cordova platform add ios</pre></li>
		<li>The output is an Xcode project, located in the subfolder <b>platforms/ios</b>. Open a Finder window and navigate to the folder, there you will find the file <b>DemoApp.xcodeproj</b>. Open this file to launch the project in Xcode. From Xcode you can run the app in the iOS simulator, or deploy the app to a devices (deploying to device requires membership in Apple's iOS Developer Program).</li>
	</ol>

<div id="SupportedPlatforms" class="box">
	<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>

	<p>Supported mobile platforms for Evothings are iOS and Android.</p>

	<p>Note that the Evothings Client app itself is built with Cordova. It is a plain Cordova app with some custom plugins added, e.g. for socket communication and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).</p>

	<p>Cordova comes with a set of plugins that are supported for a wide range of platforms. Evothings apps can use custom plugins available for iOS and Android. As long as you do not require socket communication or BLE, you should be able to use Evothings Studio to build apps for any platform supported by Cordova.</p>

	<p>The same goes for the Evothings Client app. It is available on iOS and Android, but should be possible to build from source for any platform supported by Cordova. (But you would miss the plugins not available for the target platform.) </p>

Building a native app with Apache Cordova:

		<li>Install the mobile development kit(s) you want to build for (e.g.
Android, iOS, Windows Phone).</li>
		<li>For iOS you need a Mac with Xcode and an Apple developer
 membership to install apps on devices.</li>
		<li>For Android you need the Android SDK.</li>
		<li>Install Apache Cordova and create a template app by following the
instructions in this tutorial:
http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.4.0/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-Line%20Interface</li>
		<li>The above step can take some time and effort to complete!</li>
		<li>Copy your HTML, CSS, JavaScript and media files to the www folder in
the Cordova project.</li>
		<li>Now build and test your app. The output depends on the platform. For
iOS you get an Xcode project you can open and run, for Android you get
and apk-file you can install on your device.</li>
		<li>Note that it works perfectly fine to develop the Cordova app in
Evothings Studio. Just drag and drop index.html in project list in the
Workbench window. Then run the app using Evothings client, or ...</li>
		<li>Enter the connect url in place of index.html in config.xml. When you
start the app it will connect to the Workbench, just click run to
launch your app.</li>
		<li>You can now build your app and deploy it to the app stores.</li>
		<li>Drawback: The build process can be complex and you must have the
SDKs installed and the right app store memberships. But this is on the
other hand true of any app you wish to publish.</li>
