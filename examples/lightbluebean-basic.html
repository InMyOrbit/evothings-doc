	<h1>LightBlue Bean - Basic</h1>

	<p>
		This example shows you how to build a mobile application that connects to your <a href="https://punchthrough.com/bean/">LightBlue Bean</a> and, when connected, allows you to configure the LED as well as read the ambient temperature.

	<h2>Source Code</h2>

	<p>
		You can browse the source code for this example at the <a href="https://github.com/evothings/EvoThingsExamples/tree/master/examples/lightbluebean-basic">Evothings GitHub repository</a>
	</p>

	<p>
		The file <a href="">index.html</a> contains the HTML markup of the app and the buisness logic is placed in the <a href="">app.js</a>
	</p>

<div class="evo-box">
	<h2>What You Need</h2>

	<p>
		This example runs in Evothings Client on Android or iOS.
	</p>

	<p>
		An iOS device or an Android device with support for Bluetooth 4.0 (which includes BLE) is required. For Android version 4.3 or later is needed. Please note that BLE support on Android is still not fully mature. As a result, you may experience difficulties running this example. If the app stops working, restart the Evothings client app and/or reset Bluetooth on the device.
	</p>

	<p> 
		You also need a <a href="https://punchthrough.com/bean/">LightBlue Bean</a> running the sketch provided in the <a href="https://github.com/evothings/EvoThingsExamples/tree/master/examples/lightbluebean-basic">Evothings GitHub repository</a>.
