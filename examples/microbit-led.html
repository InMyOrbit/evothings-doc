	<h2>Source code</h2>

	<p>You can browse the source code for this example at the
	<a href="https://github.com/evothings/evothings-examples/tree/2.1.0-alpha/examples/microbit-led">Evothings GitHub repository</a></p>

	<p>The file <a href="https://github.com/evothings/evothings-examples/tree/2.1.0-alpha/examples/microbit-led/index.html">index.html</a> is the main HTML file of the app.</p>

	<h2>What you need</h2>

	<img style="width:100px;height:auto;float:right;" src="images/sticknfind.jpg"/>

	<p>This example runs in Evothings Viewer on Android or iOS.</p>

	<p>You need to run the example in Evothings Viewer. Alternatively, you can make a Cordova application if you wish to distribute the app. You then need to include the Cordova plugin com.evothings.ble. Read more in the documentation of the <a href="../studio/evothings-viewer.html">Evothings Viewer</a>.</p>

	<p>An iOS device or an Android device with support for Bluetooth 4.0 (which includes BLE) is required. For Android version 4.3 or later is needed. Please note that BLE support on Android is still not fully mature. As a result, you may experience difficulties running this example. If the app stops working, restart Evothings Viewer and/or reset Bluetooth on the device.</p>

	<p>You also need a <a href="https://www.microbit.co.uk">Microbit</a> device.</p>
