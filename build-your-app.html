	<h2>The Joy of Native Apps</h2>

	<p>It is a great asset to have native apps on the app stores. This documents describes how to build and publish apps created with Evothings Studio on Apple AppStore and Google Play. The procedure for building for other Android app stores is similar to Google Play.</p>

	<p>Building and publishing a native app takes some effort. If you wish to share an app in the quickest way possible you can use the Evothings Client app. Read more at the page <a href="share-your-app.html">Share Your App</a>.</p>
</div>

<div id="ApacheCordova" class="box">
	<h2>Apache Cordova</h2>

	<p>Apache Cordova is a build system for creating native apps with bundled HTML and JavaScript content. Apps built with Cordova are native apps that can be published on the app stores. Furthermore, you can add custom native plugins to extend the functionality of your app.</p>

	<p>It may be of interest that Evothings Client is built with Cordova. It is a plain Cordova app with some custom plugins added, e.g. for socket communication and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).</p>

	<p>Supported platforms for Evothings are iOS and Android, with partial support for Windows Phone. </p>
</div>

<div id="SupportedPlatforms</h2>
" class="box">
	<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>

	<p>Supported mobile platforms for Evothings are iOS and Android, with partial support for Windows Phone. </p>

	<p>Cordova comes with a set of plugins that are supported for a wide range of platforms. The custom plugins used are available for iOS and Android. As long as you do not require socket communication or BLE, you should be able to use Evothings Studio to build apps for any platform supported by Cordova.</p>

	<p>The same goes for the Evothings Client app. It is available on iOS and Android, but should be possible to build from source for any platform supported by Cordova.</p>
</div>

<div id="Overview" class="box">
	<h2>Installation Overview</h2>

	<p>Cordova runs on your desktop/laptop machine. Here is a summary of the steps needed to get started:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Install Node.js (the basic platform for Cordova build tools).</li>
		<li>Install Apache Cordova.</li>
		<li>Install native SDKs (Xcode and/or Android SDK).</li>
		<li>Create a Cordova project.</li>
		<li>Connect the project to Evothings Studio.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Select the platform you are working on to learn about how to perform the above steps on your machine:</p>
	<p><a href="#">I develop on an OS X machine!</a></p>
	<p><a href="#">I develop on a Linux machine!</a></p>
	<p><a href="#">I develop on a Windows machine!</a></p>

	<p>The Cordova install procedure and command line tools are also described in the <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.5.0//guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-Line%20Interface">Cordova documentation</a>.</p>

	<p>As for publishing your app on the app stores, learn how to do this here:</p>
	<p><a href="#">I want to publish an iOS app on Apple AppStore!</a></p>
	<p><a href="#">I want to publish an Android app on Google Play!</a></p>
</div>


<div id="InstallCordovaOSX" class="box">
	<h2>Install Cordova on OS X</h2>
	<p>Here is how to install Cordova and mobile SDKs on OS X.</p>

	<h3>Basic Cordova Install</h3>
	<p>Follow these steps to install Cordova:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Install Node.js from: <a href="http://nodejs.org/">http://nodejs.org</a></li>
		<li>Open a terminal window.</li>
		<li>Test the installation by typing:<br/>
		<pre>node --version</pre>
		If you get the version number is response, Node.js is installed and working!</li>
		<li>You also need the git version control system, which is used by Cordova behind-the-scenes. If you don't have git installed, download and install from: <a href="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com</a>
		<li>Test git by typing:<br/>
		<pre>git --version</pre>
		If you see the version number, git is installed!</li>
		<li>Install Cordova by typing:<br/>
		<pre>sudo npm install -g cordova</pre></li>
		<li>Test the Cordova install by typing:<br/>
		<pre>cordova --version</pre>
		If you see the version number, you have succeeded!</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Install Xcode for iOS development</h3>
	<p>If you wish to develop iOS apps, go ahead and install Xcode, which is Apple's development tool for iOS app development:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>To access iOS development resources, you need to sign up for an Apple account (which you may already have).</li>
		<li>To deploy apps on devices (iPhone and iPad) and to publish apps on the AppStore, you join Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/">iOS Developer Program</a>. This costs 99 USD per year.</li>
		<li>Install Xcode from: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/">https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads</a></li>
		<li>When the install is complete, launch Xcode and enable the command line tools for Xcode (these are used by Cordova).
			<ul>
				<li>From the <b>Xcode</b> menu, select <b>Preferences...</b></li>
				<li>Select the <b>Downloads</b> tab.</li>
				<li>Under <b>Components</b>, locate <b>Command Line Tools</b> and click the download icon.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>If you get stuck, try out the <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.5.0//guide_platforms_ios_index.md.html">Cordova documentation for iOS</a>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Xcode is now ready to be used with Cordova. The way this works that that you create and build a Cordova project, the build process generates an Xcode project, that you just double-click to open. When your project is open in Xcode, you can run it in the iOS simulator or deploy the app to a device. Follow the instructions below to make this happen!</p>

	<h3>Install Android SDK</h3>
	<p>To develop Android apps, install the Android SDK as follows:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The Android SDK needs the Java SDK to be installed (min version 1.6). To check if you have Java already, type this on the command line:<br/>
		<pre>javac -version</pre>
		If you see a version number at or above 1.6 you should be good to continue. Otherwise, get <a href="http://support.apple.com/downloads/#java">Java for OS X</a>.
		</li>
		<li>Download and install the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk">Android Developer Tools (ADT)</a>.</li>
		<li>Make sure you have the path to the Android SDK tools added to the file <b>.bash_profile</b>, which is in your home directory. The path is needed for Cordova to find the Android build tools. Check if the build tools can be found by typing:<br/>
		<pre>adb version
android</pre>
		The first command should print a version number, the second command should start the android tools application (quit this if it launches). If these commands do not work, you need to add the path to the Android SDK by editing the .bash_profile file.</li>
		<li>If you need to edit .bash_profile, type the following in the terminal window (the <b>cd</b> command takes you to your home directory, in case you are unsure about where you are located in the file tree).</li><br/>
		<pre>cd
nano .bash_profile</pre>
		Now the nano editor opens (but you can use any editor you prefer). Enter the following, where you substitute "/Users/username/android" with the actual location where the Android SDK is installed (you can open the Finder or a second terminal window to search for the SDK directory):<br/>
		<pre>export PATH=/Users/username/android/sdk/platform-tools:/Users/username/android/sdk/tools:$PATH</pre>
		Save and exit by typing CTRL+O (the letter Oh) and CTRL+X.
		<li>Now try the commands <b>adb version</b> and <b>android</b> again.</li>
		<li>If you get stuck, consult the <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.5.0//guide_platforms_android_index.md.html">Cordova documentation for Android</a>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Android SDK should now be ready to be used by the Cordova build tools. Follow the instructions below to see this in action!</p>

<!--
Building a native app with Apache Cordova:

		<li>Install the mobile development kit(s) you want to build for (e.g.
Android, iOS, Windows Phone).</li>
		<li>For iOS you need a Mac with Xcode and an Apple developer
 membership to install apps on devices.</li>
		<li>For Android you need the Android SDK.</li>
		<li>Install Apache Cordova and create a template app by following the
instructions in this tutorial:
http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.4.0/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-Line%20Interface</li>
		<li>The above step can take some time and effort to complete!</li>
		<li>Copy your HTML, CSS, JavaScript and media files to the www folder in
the Cordova project.</li>
		<li>Now build and test your app. The output depends on the platform. For
iOS you get an Xcode project you can open and run, for Android you get
and apk-file you can install on your device.</li>
		<li>Note that it works perfectly fine to develop the Cordova app in
Evothings Studio. Just drag and drop index.html in project list in the
Workbench window. Then run the app using Evothings client, or ...</li>
		<li>Enter the connect url in place of index.html in config.xml. When you
start the app it will connect to the Workbench, just click run to
launch your app.</li>
		<li>You can now build your app and deploy it to the app stores.</li>
		<li>Drawback: The build process can be complex and you must have the
SDKs installed and the right app store memberships. But this is on the
other hand true of any app you wish to publish.</li>
