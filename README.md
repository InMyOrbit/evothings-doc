# Evothings Studio Documentation

This repository contains the documentation files for Evothings Studio.

## Documentation web site

The documentation is available for browsing online at the [Evothings documentation web site](https://evothings.com/doc/).

## Build of generated documentation

JSDoc is used to build documentation for JavaScript libraries. Here are instructions for how to build if you want to do this yourself.

Library source files used are found in repository [evothings-libraries](https://github.com/evothings/evothings-libraries).

The 'evothings-libraries' repo must be in a sibling folder of this repo for the build script to work. Like this:

    parent-folder
        evothings-doc
        evothings-libraries

Build using npm (Node Package Manager):

    npm init
    npm start

The output folder that contains the generated documentation is:

    lib-doc/

This folder is under version control for convince.
