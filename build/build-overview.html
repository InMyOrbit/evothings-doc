	<h1>Build and publish your app</h1>

	<p>It is time for the happy moment to share your app with others. For testing, for sharing with friends, or for publishing on the app stores.</p>

	<p>To make an Evothings app available to others, you have the following options:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><strong><a href="share-apps.html">Share your app with Evothings Viewer</a>.</strong> Put your HTML and JavaScript files on a web server and run the app
using Evothings Viewer (estimated time 15 minutes).</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="cordova-guide.html">Build a native app with Apache Cordova.</a> Install Cordova and build your app (estimated time 2 - 8 hours). Then publish it on the app stores (estimated time 4 - 16 hours depending on which app stores you target).</p></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Building and publishing a native app takes some effort. If you wish to share an app in the quickest possible way, it is recommended that you go for the first option. Start out easy and deploy your app on a web server, then run it
from Evothings Viewer.</p>

	<p>When you are ready for app store publication, learn how to build native apps with Cordova.</p>

	<p><a href="http://cordova.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Cordova</a> is a build system for creating native apps with bundled HTML and JavaScript content. Apps built with Cordova are native apps that can be published on the app stores. Furthermore, you can add plugins to extend your app with native functionality.</p>

	<p>The following are the steps to make a native app:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Install Cordova<p></li>
		<li><p>Create a Cordova project and build a native app</p></li>
		<li><p>Publish the app</p></li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div id="Install" class="evo-box">
	<h2>Installing Cordova</h2>

	<p>First step is to install Cordova. Here are installation guides for different platforms:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><a href="cordova-install-osx.html">Install Cordova on OS X</a></p></li>
		<li><p><a href="cordova-install-windows.html">Install Cordova on Windows</a></p></li>
		<li><p><a href="cordova-install-linux.html">Install Cordova on Linux</a></p></li>
	</ul>

	<p>The Cordova install procedure and command line tools are also described in the <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/index.html" target="_blank">Cordova documentation</a>.</p>
</div>

<div id="Build" class="evo-box">
	<h2>Building a native app</h2>
	<p>When you have Cordova installed, you can build a native app. Read the <a href="cordova-guide.html">Evothings Cordova Guide</a> to find out how to create and build a Cordova app and how to use Cordova with Evothings Studio. You can also consult the <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/index.html" target="_blank">Cordova documentation</a>.</p></li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div id="Publish" class="evo-box">
	<h2>Publishing your app</h2>
	<p>Final step is to publish the app on the app stores:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><a href="publish-ios.html">Publish an iOS app on Apple AppStore</a></p></li>
		<li><p><a href="publish-android.html">Publish an Android app on Google Play</a></p></li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div id="SupportedPlatforms" class="evo-box">
	<h2>Supported platforms</h2>

	<p>Supported mobile platforms for Evothings are iOS and Android.</p>

	<p>Cordova comes with a set of plugins that are supported for a wide range of platforms. Evothings apps can use custom plugins available for iOS and Android. As long as you do not require socket communication or BLE, you should be able to use Evothings Studio to build apps for any platform supported by Cordova.</p>

	<p>The same goes for Evothings Viewer. It is available on iOS and Android, but should be possible to build from source for any platform supported by Cordova. (But you would miss the plugins not available for the target platform.)</p>

	<p>Evothings Viewer is itself built with Cordova. It is a plain Cordova app with native plugins added, e.g. for socket communication and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).</p>

Building a native app with Apache Cordova:

		<li><p>Install the mobile development kit(s) you want to build for (e.g.
Android, iOS, Windows Phone).</p></li>
		<li><p>For iOS you need a Mac with Xcode and an Apple developer
 membership to install apps on devices.</p></li>
		<li><p>For Android you need the Android SDK.</p></li>
		<li><p>Install Apache Cordova and create a template app by following the
instructions in this tutorial:
http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.6.0/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-Line%20Interface</p></li>
		<li><p>The above step can take some time and effort to complete!</p></li>
		<li><p>Copy your HTML, CSS, JavaScript and media files to the www folder in
the Cordova project.</p></li>
		<li><p>Now build and test your app. The output depends on the platform. For
iOS you get an Xcode project you can open and run, for Android you get
and apk-file you can install on your device.</p></li>
		<li><p>Note that it works perfectly fine to develop the Cordova app in
Evothings Studio. Just drag and drop index.html in project list in the
Workbench window. Then run the app using Evothings Viewer, or ...</p></li>
		<li><p>Enter the connect url in place of index.html in config.xml. When you
start the app it will connect to the Workbench, just click run to
launch your app.</p></li>
		<li><p>You can now build your app and deploy it to the app stores.</p></li>
		<li><p>Drawback: The build process can be complex and you must have the
SDKs installed and the right app store memberships. But this is on the
other hand true of any app you wish to publish.</p></li>
