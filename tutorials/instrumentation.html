<h1>Instrumentation</h1>

<p>NOTE: The Instrumentation features are new in Evothings Studio 2.1.0, currently available as an early release for testers and enthusiasts - <a href="https://evothings.com/download/#alpha">download Evothings Studio 2.1.0-alpha</a>.</p>

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>The tricky part of developing mobile apps is that your code by definition runs on another device than the one you’re sitting at. Logging, for one thing. Since the beginning we’ve had support for sending logs back to the studio, by using the hyper.log command. But we can do much better and this is the first step in that direction.</p>

<p>What we’re rolling out as part of this alpha release is two new features that we hope will make your debugging simpler and your development quicker; instrumentation and file injections.</p>

<h2>Where is it?</h2>

<p>To access both features, you now need to open a new tool window, by clicking on the ‘Viewers:’ text in the lower right corner of Evothings studio.</p>

<p>The window will list all connected viewers and the make of the phone they’re running on. Feel free to click around exploring what you can do!</p>

<p><strong>...more documentation to follow shortly...</strong></p>
