	<h1>RedBearLab - Simple Control</h1>

	<p>
		This application is a reimplementation of an example application that <a href="http://redbearlab.com/">RedBearLab</a> provides (<a href="https://github.com/RedBearLab/iOS/tree/master/Examples">iOS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/RedBearLab/Android/tree/master/Examples/Chat">Android</a>). The application shows you how to communicate in both directions with your RedBearLab board. In this particular example you can send text messages in both directions.

	<h2>What You Need</h2>

	<p>
		This example runs in Evothings Client on Android or iOS, or in any web browser (mobile or desktop).
	</p>

	<p>
		An iOS device or an Android device with support for Bluetooth 4.0 (which includes BLE) is required. For Android version 4.3 or later is needed. Please note that BLE support on Android is still not fully mature. As a result, you may experience difficulties running this example. If the app stops working, restart the Evothings client app and/or reset Bluetooth on the device.
